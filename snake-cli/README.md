# Snake CLI

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game that runs in your terminal.

## How to Play

- Run the `snake.py` file from your terminal: `python3 snake.py`.
- Use the controls to move the snake (the blue block).
- Eat the fruits (the red blocks) to grow and increase your score.
- The game ends if you hit the walls (the green border) or the snake's own body.

## Controls

- `z` or `Up Arrow`: Move Up
- `s` or `Down Arrow`: Move Down
- `q` or `Left Arrow`: Move Left
- `d` or `Right Arrow`: Move Right
- `x`: Exit the game

## Installation

No special installation is needed. Just make sure you have Python installed and run the game using `python3 snake.py`.
